   <p1 class = "text-font">&emsp; &emsp; Hello and welcome to my <strong>first</strong> ever
     webpage! For documentation reasons, I have decided to make this site to record
     and publish all <a href="side.html" class = "">computer programs</a> I have contributed to and/or created. My name is Greg Weber
     and I am currently undergoing my undergraduate degree for Multi-Platform Software Development. I have
     many qualifications such as knowing languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python. I have also starting self teaching
     myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all which have lots of functionality together. I plan on getting my CompTIA certification soon too!

     &emsp; &emsp; Some need-to-know facts about me! I am a huge nerd and honestly love anime. My favorite
     anime is called Kill la Kill. It has a lot of fan service, but I think it is very interesting and has some 
     good plot points. I also love playing videogames, drumming, and skateboarding as well.
