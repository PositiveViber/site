     webpage! For documentation reasons, I have decided to make this site to record
     and publish all computer programms I have contributed to and/or created. My name is Greg Weber
     and I am currently undergoing my undergraduate degree for Multi-Platform Software Development. I have
     many qualifications such as knowing languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python. I have also starting self teaching
     myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all which have lots of functionality together.

     &emsp; &emsp; Some need-to-know facts about me! I am a huge nerd and honestly for anime. My favrotie
     anime is called Kill la Kill. It has a lot of fan service, but I think it is very interesting and has some 
     good plot points. I also love playing videogames, drumming, and skateboarding.
